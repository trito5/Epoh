# Epoh
Game for the game jam "Kodsnacks spelsylt". The theme was "hopp". The game is created in Godot.

It takes place in a cave maze. You are trapped by some creatures that makes you work and mine. You need to try to find a way out of the cave. The creaters will however keep on checking up on you, so make sure to be back in your work area when it is time for checkup. Ohh, and don't lose your hope, then it's game over.
